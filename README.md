# COMP329-Mental-Health-ChatBot
## Outline
We will be testing building a ChatBot using transfer learning from LLMs, Seq2Seq models, and potentially a neural network from scratch.
## Goal
Our goal is to optimize the model for performing the role of being a therapist/mental health expert that can converse with people looking for help or information regarding mental health.
